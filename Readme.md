<<Flex Container Properties>>

>> display :  Diaplay property this is what defines a flex container and is mandatory to work with flex box.

>> flex-direction : defines the direction in which the flex items are placed in the container.

>> flex-wrap : Used to control the wrapping of items within a container.

>> flex-flow : Is a shorthand for the combination of flex direction and flex wrap.

>> justify-content : Defines the alignment of the items along the main axis.

>> align-items : Defines how flex items are laid out along the cross axis.

>> align-content : Similar to justify-content with the difference being this will align along the cross axis instead of the main axis also align-content works only when there are multiple rows of flex items in the container.
